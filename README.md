## Projects

Some of my personal projects which are Free Open Source:

- [GRUSP](https://grusp.site): Catalogue of student clubs  at  USP  college.  It
  allows searching clubs, filtering them by topic, starring them, and leaving  a
  thumbs-up or a comment. College students and staff  can  register  clubs  they
  participate in and use the public information to get in touch and join clubs
  of their interest. The site has:
    - [public frontend](https://github.com/uwla/grusp-app)
    - [rest api](https://github.com/uwla/grusp-api)
    - [admin frontend](https://github.com/uwla/grusp-adm)
- [Starred  Repos   Organizer](https://github.com/uwla/starred_repos_organizer):
  Organize starred repositories from various sources (GitHub, GitLab,  Codeberg,
  Gitea, self-hosted Gitlab/Gitea instances), with search filter, topic  filter,
  pagination, sort by stars/name/forks, import starred repositories from  public
  profiles, export to  and  import  from  file,  edit  repository  details  (for
  example, delete or add topics), stores data locally on browser (default) or on
  a remote server (source code provides sample Node  backend  API).  Built  with
  React+TypeScript.
- [Vue Data Table](https://github.com/uwla/vue-data-table):  VueJS  plugin  that
  creates beautiful data tables with  search  filter,  pagination,  multi-column
  sorting, translation, editable cells, export  data  to  CSV/JSON/PDF/XLS/HTML,
  custom components, custom search function, and more.
- [Vue  Form  Builder](https://github.com/uwla/vue-form-builder):  VueJS  plugin
  that automatically generates beautiful forms from declarative  succinct  rules
  and integration with popular  frameworks  (Vuetify,  PrimeVue,  BootstrapVue),
  success/error feedback messages, validation on user input or form  submission,
  compatibility   with   Laravel's   error   API,   custom   field   components,
  synchronization via `v-model`, and more.
- [LTAGS](https://github.com/uwla/ltags): Laravel tagging  system  package  that
  can tag any model, fetch models from the tags,  fetch  the  model  or  models'
  tags, filter by tags, has support for nested tags, has namespace  support  for
  tags with the same name but different context, does not  require  modification
  of models or database tables, and handy API for  performing  single  and
  bulk operations.
- [LACL](https://github.com/uwla/lacl): Laravel Access Control List package that
  provides role-based access control, inherited per-role  permissions,  per-user
  permissions, permissions that apply to all instances of a  model,  permissions
  that apply to a particular model instance, automated setup of laravel policies
  for CRUD controllers, and handy API for performing single and bulk operations.
- [LN Paywall](https://github.com/uwla/lnpaywall): zero-configuration Lightning
  Network Paywall that uses reverse proxy. User must pay satoshis  in  order  to
  access web service behind the proxy. The invoices are issued and confirmed via
  a LN backend written in typescript, which talks to LN nodes , and the  reverse
  proxy is written in PHP. The whole system is  encapsulated  and  automated  by
  docker technology.
- **Justify**: plugin, library and script to justify-align  plain  text,  adding
  spaces between words so all lines have the same  width.  Useful  for  aligning
  code comments and markdown. It comprises:
    - [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/uwla/justify.vsix)
    - [Vim plugin](https://github.com/uwla/justify.vim)
    - [JavaScript library](https://github.com/uwla/justify.js)
